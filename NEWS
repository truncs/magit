Changes in magit 0.6:

* Magit works with Git 1.6.0 now.  (John Wiegley)

* Many key bindings and the behavior of many commands have changed.
  Please see the manual.

* All buffers created by Magit are now in magit-mode and share all key
  bindings.

* Bug fix: avoid looking-at-p so that magit.el works on Emacs 22 as
  well.
